Let's dive in...

## The Project

Microsoft sees all the other big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about movies. They have hired **you** to help them better understand the movie industry.

Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating. 

## Methodology 

Some areas you can look to examine are movie genres, movie ratings, budget, social media discussion, or critic/user reviews. Your team gets to *define your own questions* about the movie industry, and then use your knowledge of descriptive statistics and the exploratory data analysis process to try and answer those questions. 

## Data Sources

Microsoft does not have **any** data, so your team should use web scraping and API skills to pull the data you need.  Some great sites to pull this data from include [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/), and [TheMovieDB.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US). You are not limited to these sites, and can pull your data from any reputable site. You *must* pull data from at least two sources into this project.  

## Deliverables

Your team must prepare a 5 minute presentation that gives the CEO insights as to what type of films they should be creating to meet consumer demand. Your presentation should outline the process you went through and use at least 4 meaningful data visualizations to help illustrate your findings. Your team is expected to use git as a collaborative tool for this project to manage version control and history.

## Project Checklist

- Pull data from at least two sources

    - Establish naming conventions for variables and datasets
    - Clean datasets, *and record the parameters used to clean the data*
    - Put the data into a sqlite database

- Use Pandas to get useful statistics for comparing films

- Create a shared git repository to showcase your work, containing:

    - A readme.md listing lab members, project goals, findings etc.
    - Jupyter notebooks with clean and commented code, so any independent party could replicate your analysis
    - The final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis
    - A narrative Jupyter notebook that provides:
    - 4 well-annotated visualizations
    - 4 meaningful summary tables

- Give at least **two** actionable insights, answering questions like (but not limited to):

    - What type of films make the most money?
    - What should the budget requirements be? 
    - Should they recruit certain actors for their films?
    - How long should their films be?

- Check in with a coach as a group at least once to outline your project plan

In the end, instructors and coaches (and strangers!) should be able to view a well-commented git commit history for each element in the git repository. Git commit whenever you make changes, aiming for at least twice a day! 

## Suggestions

- Spend some up-front time diving into data acquisition - what data are you trying to get, how you're going to get it, etc. - then test out your plan to make sure it's feasible before fully committing to it

    - This might be the time to check in with a coach, to see if they have any advice!

- Don't neglect to plan out how you'll be cleaning your data. This is a great place to show off your OOP skills, creating clean reproducible code to do some data cleaning tasks consistently (you will likely then steal this code from yourself in later projects, saving yourself some work!)

    - Work together on this, since otherwise you'll both probably be doing the same things but separately!

- Plan out your questions and how you'll be doing the analysis *before* you start coding. This is the place you can likely split up the work, but be sure to keep checking in with your partner - they likely are doing cool things that you may want to use!
- Save time to clean up your notebook and repository, create and practice your presentation, and otherwise cross your t's/dot your i's. 

And remember - you got this.
