When advocate Adrian Samuels takes on the case, he is determined to prove that Ellen Pakkies had no choice. But what compelled her to stop seeking help? How does a mother become desperate enough to take her own son's life? Told across two timelines, Ellen is the harrowing account of a woman put through the penal system, tried for murder and driven by an unflinching love for her son. It delves into the inner psyche of a family ravaged by drugs in one of the most dangerous communities in South Africa.

But the impossible is another matter entirely. And on February 11, 1990, while the odds were technically 42 to 1, it was very much the impossible that happened in a boxing ring in Tokyo, Japan, when James ""Buster"" Douglas defeated Mike Tyson for the heavyweight championship of the world.  The ESPN ""30 for 30"" documentary ""42 to 1"" tells the story of just how incredibly unlikely it was. It starts in Columbus, Ohio, where Douglas grew up the son of a boxer, who trained and guided him to become a top-10 heavyweight contender in the mid 1980's. Of course, it was all in the shadow of the rise of ""Iron"" Mike Tyson, who became a worldwide phenomenon in a remarkable undefeated run to the undisputed title. And by the time their fight was set, Douglas was lightly regarded, merely a stepping stone for bigger fights for the champion.

Apart from ‘Black to Blues’, an EP that gives a number of blues classics a BSC makeover, there is also their 5th studio album ‘Kentucky’ (2016). Whereas Magic Mountain (2014) was somewhat heavier than its predecessors, ‘Kentucky’ is more versatile and showcases the full spectrum of Black Stone Cherry’s songwriting abilities.

Looking for an avenue back into the spotlight with fading football prospects, Jimmy decides to convince his best friend Eugene (a skilled drummer and somewhat nerdy pre-med student) that they should form a band. With neither being talented lyricists, they recruit Ryan to write lyrics for them in a self-centered and ill-intentioned move. Throughout the film, both Ryan and Jimmy seek fame through music, a quest for the quintessential rock star life, while failing to accept where their true talents and abilities lie.

But the staff at the zoo knew they could save her. They had to study the makeup of hippo milk for the first time ever and reach out to medical colleagues, including a team at the local children's hospital with superior vein-finding skills, to ensure that Fiona would begin to gain weight and become healthy.

The arrival of cotton gave them the opportunity to become slave masters and wealthy plantation owners, but the Civil War left them embittered. Because of that, six Scottish-American former Confederate officers formed a fraternal society that became the oldest and most feared hate group in America: the Ku Klux Klan.  At the turn of the twentieth century, a racist novel by another Scots American became a bestseller, and the famous film based on it, The Birth of a Nation, revitalized the Klan.
