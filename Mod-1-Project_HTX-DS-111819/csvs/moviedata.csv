We become once more optimistic, before becoming fearful of it. The dream for decades had been for a computer with AI to be embedded within a humanoid robot, but just as scientists began to perfect machines with these qualities, something happened nobody expected.  Today, AI systems power our daily lives through smart technology. We are currently experiencing a level of fear about the power of AI, but will we enter the next decade optimistic about all that AI can deliver - or fearful of its ability to control vast areas of our lives?",2018-09-04

A threatening connection between David and a television self-help hypnotist summons suspicion in Julian, and fears of conspiracy.  Paris Window is a narrative experiment, a film that generates its own logic and cinematic grammar. An upside down Buñuel universe with touch of noir, and a pinch of Chaplin.

The arrival of cotton gave them the opportunity to become slave masters and wealthy plantation owners, but the Civil War left them embittered. Because of that, six Scottish-American former Confederate officers formed a fraternal society that became the oldest and most feared hate group in America: the Ku Klux Klan.  At the turn of the twentieth century, a racist novel by another Scots American became a bestseller, and the famous film based on it, The Birth of a Nation, revitalized the Klan. Now, well over 1,000 hate groups stalk America, including the League of the South, which advocates a separate Southern society run by ""Anglo Celts.""",2018-02-08
